Challenge for Module 5 - Data Visualization

Submission for Challenge 5. 
In this exercise, I applied the concepts learned in class on DataFrame manipulation and series mathematics, and data visualization concepts combined with statistics.
I made some comments on the code (starting with {JT} to add clarity/information on some of the steps and to explain the logic.)
